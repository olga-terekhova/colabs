# colabs
A collection of useful google colab notebooks.

[Get_UFLI_Toolbox](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/colabs/blob/main/Get_UFLI_Toolbox.ipynb)  
Downloaded selected resources from the UFLI toolboxes. Specify by lesson number, resource type.  

[Trip_Timeline_Creator](https://github.com/olga-terekhova/colabs/blob/main/Trip_Timeline_Creator.ipynb)  
Create timeline and merged PDFs from a collection of files with trip bookings (transport, accommodation). Works well for several groups of people going on the same trip: each group gets their own swimlane on the timeline and their own single PDF file with all relevant documents.
